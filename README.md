# FlashCards Project

## Abstract:
This project is about making a flashcards game that users can play on the command line. The aim is to design a program where users can see questions, guess answers, and get feedback on how well they did. It is focusing on making sure every part of the program does one thing well, in line with the Single Responsibility Principle. This program is based on Test-Driven Development (TDD) to make sure everything works as intended. The project is broken down into stages, each tackling different parts of the game like creating cards, handling decks, and managing game rounds. 

## Installation Instructions:
Clone down the git(git@github.com:sanghoro/flashcards-starter.git) and type in "node index.js" to start the game.
